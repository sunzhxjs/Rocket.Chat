## 6.9.0

### Minor Changes

- ([#31917](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31917)) Introduced a tab layout to the users page and implemented a tab called "All" that lists all users.

- ([#32439](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32439)) Allow visitors & integrations to access downloaded files after a room has closed. This was a known limitation in our codebase, where visitors were only able to access uploaded files in a livechat conversation while the conversation was open.

- ([#32233](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32233)) Makes the triggers fired by the condition `after-guest-registration` persist on the livechat client, it will persist through reloads and pagination, only reseting when a conversation is closed (no changes were done on the agent side of the conversation)

- ([#32193](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32193)) Adds CheckOption to departments multi selects improving options visibility state

- ([#32317](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32317)) Replace the read receipt receipt indicator in order to improve the accessibility complience

- ([#32341](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32341)) Changes the scrollbar color in order to improve the contrast and accessibility compliance

- ([#32298](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32298)) Added "Rocket.Chat Cloud Workspace ID" to workspace statistics page

### Patch Changes

- ([#32393](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32393)) Fixed an issue causing monitors to dissapear from a saved unit every time a user saved the item. This was caused by the UI not sending the correct \_id of the monitors that were already saved, and this caused the Backend to ignore them and remove from the list.

- ([#31695](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31695)) Fix an issue where read receipts menu item wasn't considering the enabled setting to be displayed

- Bump @rocket.chat/meteor version.

- Bump @rocket.chat/meteor version.

- Bump @rocket.chat/meteor version.

- ([#32454](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32454)) Fixes an issue not allowing override retention policy in channels

- ([#32444](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32444)) Fixed an issue that prevented CAS users from being merged with existing user data on login

- ([#32289](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32289)) Fixed a problem in how server was processing errors that was sending 2 ephemeral error messages when @all or @here were used while they were disabled via permissions

- ([#32348](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32348)) Fixed an issue where translations would fallback to english some of the times.

- ([#32182](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32182)) Fixed an issue with object storage settings that was not allowing admins to decide if files generated via "Export conversation" feature were being proxied through server or not.

- ([#32311](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32311)) Fixed multiple issues with PDF generation logic when a quoted message was too big to fit in one single page. This was causing an internal infinite loop within the library (as it tried to make it fit, failing and then trying to fit on next page where the same happened thus causing a loop).
  The library was not able to break down some nested views and thus was trying to fit the whole quote on one single page. Logic was updated to allow wrapping of the contents when messages are quoted (so they can span multiple lines) and removed a bunch of unnecesary views from the code.
- ([#32364](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32364)) Fixed issue with "Export room as file" feature (`rooms.export` endpoint) generating an empty export when given an invalid date

- ([#32314](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32314)) Fixed an issue on Users converter that was not returning the `statusText` property from users even when the typing indicated property existed.

- ([#32500](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32500)) Fix user not being set as online when setting "Use REST instead of websocket for Meteor calls" is disabled

- ([#32391](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32391)) Fixes link image preview not opening in gallery mode

- ([#32318](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32318)) Fixed error handling for files bigger than NATS max allowed payload. This should prevent PDFs from erroring out when generating from rooms that contain heavy images.

- ([#32479](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32479)) Executing a logout and login action in the same "tab/instance", some streams were not being recreated, causing countless types of bugs.

  PS: as a workaround reloading after logout or login in also solves the problem.

- ([#32345](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32345)) Replaces the burger menu with an appropriate button fixing the semantics and mismatching color

- ([#32414](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32414)) Fixes the missing spacing on don`t ask again checkbox inside modals

- ([#32269](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32269)) Fixed a bad behavior with the interaction between OTR system messages & trash collection. We use trash collection as a temporary storage that holds recently deleted items from some collections. Messages is one of those. This was causing "User joined OTR" messages to be viewable when querying the trash collection.
  Since OTR messages are by definition private, code was updated to bypass trash collection when removing these special messages.

  Note: this only applies to these system messages. OTR user's messages are not stored on the database.

- ([#32415](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32415)) This fuselage`s bump fixes:

  - The message toolbar visibility on hover (Firefox ESR)
  - `Bubble` missing font-family

  [more details](https://github.com/RocketChat/fuselage/releases/tag/%40rocket.chat%2Ffuselage%400.53.7)

- ([#32398](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32398)) Fixed issue with external users being able to reset their passwords even when the "Allow Password Change for OAuth Users" setting is disabled

- ([#32284](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32284)) fixed Engagement Dashboard and Device Management admin pages loading indefinitely

- ([#32342](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32342)) bump fuselage adding `AttachmentAuthorName` missing color token

## 6.9.0-rc.0

### Minor Changes

- ([#31917](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31917)) Introduced a tab layout to the users page and implemented a tab called "All" that lists all users.

- ([#32439](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32439)) Allow visitors & integrations to access downloaded files after a room has closed. This was a known limitation in our codebase, where visitors were only able to access uploaded files in a livechat conversation while the conversation was open.

- ([#32233](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32233)) Makes the triggers fired by the condition `after-guest-registration` persist on the livechat client, it will persist through reloads and pagination, only reseting when a conversation is closed (no changes were done on the agent side of the conversation)

- ([#32193](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32193)) Adds CheckOption to departments multi selects improving options visibility state

- ([#32317](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32317)) Replace the read receipt receipt indicator in order to improve the accessibility complience

- ([#32341](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32341)) Changes the scrollbar color in order to improve the contrast and accessibility compliance

- ([#32298](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32298)) Added "Rocket.Chat Cloud Workspace ID" to workspace statistics page

### Patch Changes

- ([#32393](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32393)) Fixed an issue causing monitors to dissapear from a saved unit every time a user saved the item. This was caused by the UI not sending the correct \_id of the monitors that were already saved, and this caused the Backend to ignore them and remove from the list.

- ([#31695](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31695)) Fix an issue where read receipts menu item wasn't considering the enabled setting to be displayed

- ([#32454](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32454)) Fixes an issue not allowing override retention policy in channels

- ([#32444](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32444)) Fixed an issue that prevented CAS users from being merged with existing user data on login

- ([#32289](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32289)) Fixed a problem in how server was processing errors that was sending 2 ephemeral error messages when @all or @here were used while they were disabled via permissions

- ([#32348](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32348)) Fixed an issue where translations would fallback to english some of the times.

- ([#32182](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32182)) Fixed an issue with object storage settings that was not allowing admins to decide if files generated via "Export conversation" feature were being proxied through server or not.

- ([#32311](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32311)) Fixed multiple issues with PDF generation logic when a quoted message was too big to fit in one single page. This was causing an internal infinite loop within the library (as it tried to make it fit, failing and then trying to fit on next page where the same happened thus causing a loop).
  The library was not able to break down some nested views and thus was trying to fit the whole quote on one single page. Logic was updated to allow wrapping of the contents when messages are quoted (so they can span multiple lines) and removed a bunch of unnecesary views from the code.
- ([#32364](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32364)) Fixed issue with "Export room as file" feature (`rooms.export` endpoint) generating an empty export when given an invalid date

- ([#32314](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32314)) Fixed an issue on Users converter that was not returning the `statusText` property from users even when the typing indicated property existed.

- ([#32391](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32391)) Fixes link image preview not opening in gallery mode

- ([#32318](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32318)) Fixed error handling for files bigger than NATS max allowed payload. This should prevent PDFs from erroring out when generating from rooms that contain heavy images.

- ([#32345](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32345)) Replaces the burger menu with an appropriate button fixing the semantics and mismatching color

- ([#32414](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32414)) Fixes the missing spacing on don`t ask again checkbox inside modals

- ([#32269](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32269)) Fixed a bad behavior with the interaction between OTR system messages & trash collection. We use trash collection as a temporary storage that holds recently deleted items from some collections. Messages is one of those. This was causing "User joined OTR" messages to be viewable when querying the trash collection.
  Since OTR messages are by definition private, code was updated to bypass trash collection when removing these special messages.

  Note: this only applies to these system messages. OTR user's messages are not stored on the database.

- ([#32415](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32415)) This fuselage`s bump fixes:

  - The message toolbar visibility on hover (Firefox ESR)
  - `Bubble` missing font-family

  [more details](https://github.com/RocketChat/fuselage/releases/tag/%40rocket.chat%2Ffuselage%400.53.7)

- ([#32398](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32398)) Fixed issue with external users being able to reset their passwords even when the "Allow Password Change for OAuth Users" setting is disabled

- ([#32284](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32284)) fixed Engagement Dashboard and Device Management admin pages loading indefinitely

- ([#32342](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32342)) bump fuselage adding `AttachmentAuthorName` missing color token

- ([#31976](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31976)) Added support for allowing agents to forward inquiries to departments that may not have any online agents given that `Allow department to receive forwarded inquiries even when there's no available agents` is set to `true` in the department configuration.
  This configuration empowers agents to seamlessly direct incoming requests to the designated department, ensuring efficient handling of queries even when departmental resources are not actively online. When an agent becomes available, any pending inquiries will be automatically routed to them if the routing algorithm supports it.
- ([#32173](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32173)) Added "Enable Users" option under "Sync User Active State" LDAP setting to allow only re-enabling users found on LDAP background sync

- ([#32210](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32210)) Fixes error `audio.pause() is not a function` and makes the continuous new room notification (livechat) respect the volume set in user preferences.

- Bump @rocket.chat/meteor version.

- Bump @rocket.chat/meteor version.

- Bump @rocket.chat/meteor version.

- ([#32186](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32186)) Increased the timeout between calls for the three remaining Omnichannel Agenda Jobs. This should make them happen less often and reduce the load on MongoDB

- ([#32216](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32216)) Fixed an issue while creating tokens via the special `users.createToken` API was not respecting the maximum login tokens allowed for a user.

  The following endpoint was deprecated and will be removed on version `8.0.0`:

  - `/api/v1/users.createToken`

  The following Meteor method (realtime API) was deprecated and will be removed on version `8.0.0`:

  - `createToken`

- ([#31990](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31990)) Fixed open expanded view (galery mode) for image attachments sent by livechat widget

- ([#32248](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32248)) Fixes an issue where the last threads list item wasn't displaying properly

- ([#32063](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32063)) Fixed a UI issue that allowed a user to "mark" a room as favorite even when a room was not default. The Back-End was correctly ignoring the `favorite` property from being updated when the room was not default, but the UI still allowed users to try.
  As UI allowed but changes were not saved, this gave the impression that the function was not working.
- ([#32374](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32374)) Fixed an issue with some apps that didn't implement executeViewCloseHandler. This causes opened modals to be open forever on UI (unless Esc was clicked). This is because when the UI attempts to close it, it calls the aforementioned handler, and since it didn't exist, apps engine errored out.

  This returned an empty response to the UI, which ignored the response and continued to show the view.

- ([#32237](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32237)) **Fixed settings-related statistics not being updated according to the license.**

  We've identified an issue where certain statistics were not reflecting recent license changes. This resulted in outdated information being reported for workspaces.
  This change ensures that all reported statistics are current and consider the workspace license.

- ([#32170](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32170)) Fixed a language priority issue. It should now respect the following order: User Preference -> Browser Language -> Server Language

- ([#32202](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32202)) Fixed an issue where Rocket.Chat would ask admins to confirm fingerprint change (new workspace vs configuration update), even when `AUTO_ACCEPT_FINGERPRINT` environment variable set to `"true"`.

- ([#32220](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32220)) Fixed supported versions not being updated in airgapped environments

- ([#32141](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32141)) Deprecate `channels.images` in favor of `rooms.images`. `Rooms` endpoints are more broad and should interact with all types of rooms. `Channels` on the other hand are specific to public channels.
  This change is to keep the semantics and conventions of the endpoints
- ([#32157](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32157)) Fixed custom OAuth roles not synced on the first login (on user creation)

- ([#32136](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32136)) Fixes the missing space between name and user name on system messages

- ([#32007](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32007)) This PR have made enhancements to the select and multiselect inputs related to Omnichannel Departments, now the options properly display the complete department names, ensuring clarity for users and added text wrapping for long department names, enhancing readability and UX.

- ([#32221](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32221)) Fixed an issue where an endpoint was called before checking configuration that enables automatic translation when launching the application

- ([#32230](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32230)) Fixed a problem that caused OTR Session messages' to not being transmitted from one peer to another when running Rocket.Chat as microservices. This was caused by a legacy streamer that tried to use the websocket directly, which works on monolith but doesn't on microservices, cause these events are routed through DDP Streamer service.

- ([#32021](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32021)) Fixed duplicate API calls during livechat room forwarding by adding loading state for submit button

- ([#32123](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32123)) fixed search room not showing the new name room name changes

- ([#30309](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/30309)) Fixed a problem that caused `afterCreateUser` callback to be called without new user's roles inside. This caused Omnichannel Business Hour manager to ignore these users from assigning open business hours until the manager restarted or the business hour restarted.

- ([#32172](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32172)) Fixes an issue where message reactions are vertically misaligned when zooming out

- ([#32062](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32062)) Fixed an issue where old exports would get overwritten by new ones if generated on the same day, when using external storage services (such as Amazon S3)

- ([#32284](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32284)) fixed Engagement Dashboard and Device Management admin pages loading indefinitely

- ([#31996](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31996)) Fixed Security tab visibility to allow password changes when 2FA/E2E is disabled.

- ([#32210](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32210)) Fixes error `audio.pause() is not a function` and makes the continuous new room notification (livechat) respect the volume set in user preferences.

- ([#32186](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32186)) Increased the timeout between calls for the three remaining Omnichannel Agenda Jobs. This should make them happen less often and reduce the load on MongoDB

- ([#32063](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32063)) Fixed a UI issue that allowed a user to "mark" a room as favorite even when a room was not default. The Back-End was correctly ignoring the `favorite` property from being updated when the room was not default, but the UI still allowed users to try.
  As UI allowed but changes were not saved, this gave the impression that the function was not working.

- ([#32141](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32141)) Deprecate `channels.images` in favor of `rooms.images`. `Rooms` endpoints are more broad and should interact with all types of rooms. `Channels` on the other hand are specific to public channels.

- ([#32230](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32230)) Fixed a problem that caused OTR Session messages' to not being transmitted from one peer to another when running Rocket.Chat as microservices. This was caused by a legacy streamer that tried to use the websocket directly, which works on monolith but doesn't on microservices, cause these events are routed through DDP Streamer service.

- ([#32021](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32021)) Fixed duplicate API calls during livechat room forwarding by adding loading state for submit button

- ([#32172](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32172)) Fixes an issue where message reactions are vertically misaligned when zooming out

- ([#31970](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31970)) **Fixed enterprise settings value not being updated when license is removed or invalid**

  Added a license callbacks `onRemoveLicense` and `onInvalidateLicense` to update enterprise settings values when a license is removed/invalid.
  This solves a specific scenario where in case of a downgrade (license removal), `settings.get` would continue to return `value` for enterprise settings instead of `invalidValue` as it should.
  This would remain the case until the workspace was restarted.

- ([#31904](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31904)) fix: Show always all rooms when requesting chat history, even unserved ones.

Now, the Chat history feature will showcase all closed rooms for the requested visitor.

- ([#31896](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31896)) fix: Validate rooms are not taken before processing by queue. This will prevent an issue that caused a room, that's on an invalid state, to be re-processed by the queue worker, assigning it again to another user despite being already assigned to one. This happens when a room's inquiry gets to an state where it desyncs from the room object. Room is taken & served while inquiry is still queued. This fix will also reconciliate both when something like this happens: whenever the queue picks a chat that's already taken, it will update it's inquiry object to reflect that and avoid processing again.

- ([#31823](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31823)) Revert unintentional changes real time presence data payload

- ([#32038](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32038)) **Added tag to premium settings in CE workspaces**

  A premium tag will be displayed alongside the setting label for premium exclusive settings in CE workspaces.
  This will bring visibility for users of our premium features while also informing them of the reason why the setting is currently disabled.

- ([#31998](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31998)) Introduced a new step to the queue worker: when an inquiry that's on an improper status is selected for processing, queue worker will first check its status and will attempt to fix it.
  For example, if an inquiry points to a closed room, there's no point in processing, system will now remove the inquiry
  If an inquiry is already taken, the inquiry will be updated to reflect the new status and clean the queue.

  This prevents issues where the queue worker attempted to process an inquiry _forever_ because it was in an improper state.

- ([#32056](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32056)) Fix error during migration 304. Throwing `Cannot read property 'finally' of undefined` error.

- ([#31658](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31658)) Fixes an issue where messages are not updating properly after pruning the room

- ([#31909](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31909)) fix: Trigger `IPostLivechatRoomStarted` app event after inquiry is created.

- ([#31881](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31881)) Fixed a problem that caused Business Hours feature (Multiple) to make bot agents not available when turning on the feature, and not making them available after that.

- ([#31970](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31970)) **Fixed enterprise settings value not being updated when license is removed or invalid**

  Added a license callbacks `onRemoveLicense` and `onInvalidateLicense` to update enterprise settings values when a license is removed/invalid.
  This solves a specific scenario where in case of a downgrade (license removal), `settings.get` would continue to return `value` for enterprise settings instead of `invalidValue` as it should.
  This would remain the case until the workspace was restarted.

- ([#31844](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31844)) Fixed Federation not working with Microservice deployments

- ([#31927](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31927)) `stopped` lifecycle method was unexpectedly synchronous when using microservices, causing our code to create race conditions.

Now, the Chat history feature will showcase all closed rooms for the requested visitor.

- ([#31896](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31896)) fix: Validate rooms are not taken before processing by queue. This will prevent an issue that caused a room, that's on an invalid state, to be re-processed by the queue worker, assigning it again to another user despite being already assigned to one. This happens when a room's inquiry gets to an state where it desyncs from the room object. Room is taken & served while inquiry is still queued. This fix will also reconciliate both when something like this happens: whenever the queue picks a chat that's already taken, it will update it's inquiry object to reflect that and avoid processing again.

- ([#31823](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31823)) Revert unintentional changes real time presence data payload

- ([#32038](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32038)) **Added tag to premium settings in CE workspaces**

  A premium tag will be displayed alongside the setting label for premium exclusive settings in CE workspaces.
  This will bring visibility for users of our premium features while also informing them of the reason why the setting is currently disabled.

- ([#31998](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/31998)) Introduced a new step to the queue worker: when an inquiry that's on an improper status is selected for processing, queue worker will first check its status and will attempt to fix it.
  For example, if an inquiry points to a closed room, there's no point in processing, system will now remove the inquiry
  If an inquiry is already taken, the inquiry will be updated to reflect the new status and clean the queue.

  This prevents issues where the queue worker attempted to process an inquiry _forever_ because it was in an improper state.

- ([#32056](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/32056)) Fix error during migration 304. Throwing `Cannot read property 'finally' of undefined` error.

- b4b2cd20a8: Fixed an issue caused by the `Fallback Forward Department` feature. Feature could be configured by admins in a way that mimis a loop, causing a chat to be forwarded "infinitely" between those departments. System will now prevent Self & 1-level deep circular references from being saved, and a new setting is added to control the maximum number of hops that the system will do between fallback departments before considering a transfer failure.

  The fingerprint is composed by `${siteUrl}${dbConnectionString}` and hashed via `sha256` in `base64`.
  An environment variable named `AUTO_ACCEPT_FINGERPRINT`, when set to `true`, can be used to auto-accept an expected fingerprint change as a regular deployment update.

- 3ce070a3de: fix: wrong client hash calculation due to race condition on assets

  Some deployments may suffer from some reloads if running multiple instances. It's caused by different client hashes generated due to a possible race condition on custom assets load at the startup time. Forcing the clients to talk to the right backend instances, which causes reloads if sticky sessions are not enabled.
  This change removes the assets from the hash calculation preventing the race condition and possible different hashes. After this change, the clients will not reload when the admin changes assets.

- ad7e52b742: Enable the option `Only allow verified users to login` to SaaS environment
- 8668485fda: fix: immediate auto reload issues

  Immediate auto reload increases server load on restarts/upgrades and increases the chance of getting 404 on Meteor's config file blocking the UI on a loading screen

  This change adds delays on front and backend codes on automatic client reload:

  - Front-end, adds a warning message including the old and new hashes, and a delay of 60 seconds after being notified by the server
  - Back-end, delays the client notifications on a random value between 2 and 10 minutes per connection, allowing different clients to reload at different moments and distributing the load along the time.

- 3ce070a3de: fix: wrong client hash calculation due to race condition on assets

  Some deployments may suffer from some reloads if running multiple instances. It's caused by different client hashes generated due to a possible race condition on custom assets load at the startup time. Forcing the clients to talk to the right backend instances, which causes reloads if sticky sessions are not enabled.
  This change removes the assets from the hash calculation preventing the race condition and possible different hashes. After this change, the clients will not reload when the admin changes assets.

## 6.5.0-rc.3

### Patch Changes

- Bump @rocket.chat/meteor version.
- 8668485fda: fix: immediate auto reload issues

  Immediate auto reload increases server load on restarts/upgrades and increases the chance of getting 404 on Meteor's config file blocking the UI on a loading screen

  This change adds delays on front and backend codes on automatic client reload:

  - Front-end, adds a warning message including the old and new hashes, and a delay of 60 seconds after being notified by the server
  - Back-end, delays the client notifications on a random value between 2 and 10 minutes per connection, allowing different clients to reload at different moments and distributing the load along the time.

- 57deb49ceb: fix: OAuth login by redirect failing on firefox
- 00875fc9ab: fix: wrong client hash calculation due to race condition on assets

  Some deployments may suffer from some reloads if running multiple instances. It's caused by different client hashes generated due to a possible race condition on custom assets load at the startup time. Forcing the clients to talk to the right backend instances, which causes reloads if sticky sessions are not enabled.
  This change removes the assets from the hash calculation preventing the race condition and possible different hashes. After this change, the clients will not reload when the admin changes assets.

- b7ea8651bf: fix: immediate auto reload issues

  Immediate auto reload increases server load on restarts/upgrades and increases the chance of getting 404 on Meteor's config file blocking the UI on a loading screen

  This change adds delays on front and backend codes on automatic client reload:
